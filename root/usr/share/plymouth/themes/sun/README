ubuntu-sunrise
Another modification of the awesome plymouth theme made by Andre "Osku" Schmidt


Then extract the contents of the zip INT2MIL-Ubuntu-10.04-Eng to your home or Desktop folder, then open a terminal and run this (firstly navigate to the folder where you extracted it using a terminal; if you extracted it on your Desktop, that would be: cd ~/Desktop):

sudo cp -R Earth-sunrise/ /lib/plymouth/themes/
sudo update-alternatives --install /lib/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth default.plymouth /lib/plymouth/themes/Earth-sunrise/Earth-sunrise.plymouth 100
sudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth  #here, choose the number of the theme you want to use then hit enter
sudo update-initramfs -u

Reboot and ready... should be running the new theme.

code notes
==========

the "offset" variable is used to set the y position of the planet top. 
0 would be center, positive values go down and negative to top of screen.
(all parts should use this offset)

if you scroll past the image/sprite definitions, you see some *.start and
*.end values. those say at which "progress-time" (from 0 to 1) that part
will be faded in. 

sunGlow also has .animStart/End "progress-time", to say when to move from
.startPos to .endPos on the screen
